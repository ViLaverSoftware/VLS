# VLS Libray {#vls}
The VLS Library is an open source C++ software library created by ViLaverSoftware IVS.

For more than 12 years I have been developing C++ software and have used lots of great open source libraries. 
Working on VLS Library is my way of trying to give something usefull back to the comunity.
I will do my very best to provide software of the heighest quality so all bug reports, improvement suggestions or comments are very wellcome.
