General Instructions for using doxygen for newcomers

Step 0: Install Doxygen from : http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html.

Step 0a (optional): For windows, an Environment Variable can be added in order for us to able to run "doxygen" on the command line. 
In order to do that, go to System Properties, Advanced-> Environment Variables, choose "Path" and then  "Edit...", and finally add a
new line with the location of "doxygen.exe".

Step 1: Generate a configuration file: Doxygen uses a configuration file to determine all of its settings and this file can be generated
writing the following command on the command line: "doxygen -g <config-file>" where <config-file> is the name of the configuration file.

Step 2: Edit the configuration file: Edit all parameters needed on the configuration file according to all desired functionalities and 
options  for the final documentation and source code to be documented.

Step 3: Generate the whole documentation: Run on the command line the following: "doxygen -g <config-file>".

Step 4: Enjoy your documented project :-) .
